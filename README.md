**Problem Statement**

This project aims to provide an interactive application that allows users to explore and compare the statistical attributes of Pokémon from different generations. The primary objective is to enable users to analyze the strongest and weakest Pokémon within a chosen generation, and to visualize their individual and average statistics through graphs and tables.

**Objectives**
- **Dataset Utilization**: Load Pokémon statistics data from various generations. Process and filter the data to provide accurate and relevant information to users.

- **Interactive User Interface**: Develop an intuitive user interface that allows users to select a Pokémon generation and choose between viewing the strongest or weakest Pokémon within that generation.

- **Statistical Visualization**: Display Pokémon statistics through tables and graphs, providing users with a clear understanding of each Pokémon's attributes and how they compare to the average for their generation.

- **Visual Representation**: Include images of Pokémon to enhance user experience, allowing users to see what each Pokémon looks like visually.

- **Code Quality**: Follow best coding practices and adhere to SOLID principles to ensure maintainability, readability, and reusability of the codebase.

- **Version Control**: Maintain a well-structured Git history in a GitHub repository to track code changes and facilitate collaboration.

- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of critical functionalities, ensuring reliable and accurate results.

- **Dockerization**: Dockerize the application to enable seamless deployment across different environments with minimal dependencies.
